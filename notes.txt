GitHub Actions help you automate tasks 
software development life cycle 

GitHub Actions are event-driven, meaning that you can run a series of commands after a specified event has occurred 

The workflow is an automated procedure that you add to your repository. 
Workflows are made up of one or more jobs and can be scheduled or triggered by an event. 
The workflow can be used to build, test, package, release, or deploy a project on GitHub.

An event is a specific activity that triggers a workflow. 

A job is a set of steps that execute on the same runner.
